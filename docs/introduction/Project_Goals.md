# Project Goals

Targets is strives to:

* **Provide a feature-rich task scheduling framework/platform which makes the authoring of developer tooling fast, easy and fun.**

* **Keep functionality modular and sharable**

* **Be equally usable by humans and by machines**.

    * Tools build with Targets will present a straight-forward interface and display easy to understand output.
    * Targets support multiple run modes in order to adapt the interface and output to the use case. I.E. A "dev" mode and a "tty" mode for humans as well as a "ci" mode for use on automation servers.

* **Provide a declarative solution whenever it is reasonable to do so.**

    * Targets currently supports the declaration of shell commands and HTTP requests out-of-the-box. Additionally, Targets allows for custom "loaders" to be provided via options— this allows users to author their own custom spec interpreters.
    * Targets enforces that all side-effects which arise from the mutation of config or from global state change be declared via "operations".

* **Make configuration easy and flexible**.

    * So much work and thought has gone into how Targets considers and handles configuration that its config system was lifted out of the framework and now exists as two separate modules: [Answers](https://github.com/machellerogden/answers) and [Sugar Merge](https://github.com/machellerogden/sugarmerge). Configuration with Targets continues to evolve.
